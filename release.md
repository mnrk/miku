ANN: miku: a minimal web dev DSL

miku is a DSL built on hack. It allows you to easily define routes, build your custom template backends through a simple Template interface, and integrate with other hack middleware.

* driver

    The simplest app looks like this

        import Network.Miku
        import Hack2.Handler.Happstack

        main = run . miku - get "/" (text "miku power")
        
* route

        get "/hello" - do
          text "hello"

    will route "/hello" to a controller that outputs hello.

* middleware

    using a middleware is just as declaring

        middleware lambda
        
* template

    the template interface is

        class Template a where
          interpolate :: a -> String -> Context -> IO String

    Context is just [(String, String)]

    After implementing your own template engine, you can use
    
        output - your-engine-constructor "template-name"

* demo

    I put the source of a dummy paste app on itself:

miku is on hackage, mikupaste is in miku repo on github:

happy hacking
